# JavaModellingLanguageWorkingExamples
This repository contains few working examples of Java Modelling Language - A software verification language for Java.

A part of my research involved trying to understand the software verification systems. There are many software verification tools available. The one I focused on is Java Modelling Language which is specifically developed to work with Java. I used OpenJML to perform software verification on different programs listed out in the repository. OpenJML is a program verification tool for Java programs that allows you to check the specifications of programs annotated in the Java Modeling Language.
